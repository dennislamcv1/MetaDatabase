    "Little Lemon is developing a Python-based application that needs to use MySQL in the back end so that they can store day-to-day data on bookings, orders and menus in their database’s respective tables.  They have all the required components installed to store the data. However, they need help to establish a connection between Python and the MySQL server so that they can access and communicate with the database using Python. \n",
