    "To complete this lab, you need to install Python and MySQL. Then you need to install MySQL Connector/Python client or API on your Python environment. Follow the instructions in previous videos to install the required packages or software.  \n",

    "To work with MySQL using Python, you must have an authorized user account on the MySQL server.  \n",

    "## Scenario: \n",
    "\n",
    "Little Lemon’s guests need to access the database for any booking or inquiry, for example, reading the menu. Little Lemon, therefore, needs to establish a connection between the Python and MySQL databases for every operation.  Establishing a connection every time is resource intensive and it is affecting the performance of the Little Lemon application. To improve the performance of the application, Little Lemon needs to establish a pool of database connections to facilitate the guests’ inquiries to the database. \n",
